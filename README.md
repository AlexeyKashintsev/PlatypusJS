# PlatypusJS
The Platypus.js is a JavaScript applications platform for rapid development of enterprise-level applications.

Platypus.js is server side JavaScript platform designed on top of JavaEE technology stack and uses Nashorn JavaScript engine.

Platypus.js comprises both asynchronous IO model and reasonable use of multithreading with only few intensivly used threads.

Platypus.js provides a developer with all libraries needed to develop complete ready for market applications.

In general, two programming languages are used while developing Platypus.js applications:
* JavaScript (ECMA-262-3 standard) for application logic implementation both on server side and client side.
* Sql for accessing relational databases.

Application creation and editing, deployment, debugging and maintenance are performed using the Platypus.js IDE based on the NetBeans RCP. However, individual files, for example, JavaScript modules, can be edited in any text editor.

The Platypus.js IDE includes following development tools:

* Application database structure visual editor.
* SQL queries visual editor.
* JavaScript code editor.
* User interface forms visual editor.

## Features
The platform offers a set of features, making development process extremely productive:
* Server side JavaScript modules within IoC paradigm with LPC (Local procedure calls) asynchronous interactions.
* Parallel execution scheme of JavaScript code, based on Platypus.js IoC.
* JavaScript modules automatic dependencies resolving, manual resolving is also avaliable.
* Sql queries with named parameters and Sql clauses re-use.
* Data model and ORM (Object-Relation Mapping) for JavaScript.
* Desktop cross-platform as well as HTML5 web-browser user interface presentation sharing the same code and the GUI layout.
* The GUI widgets which directly interact with the data model, allowing implementation of a CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) user interface with visual configuration and without or just a little coding.
* Built-in security support, including users authentication and authorization, constraints of access to application resources.
* Application database schema structure and initial applicaton data migrations tools.
